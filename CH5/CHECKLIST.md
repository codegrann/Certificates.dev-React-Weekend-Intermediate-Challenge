- The `App` component now uses the `MovieItem` component instead of inline JSX
- The `MovieItem` component accepts the movie as a prop
- The `MovieItem` component is further broken down into smaller components with clear hierarchy (i.e, `MovieRatingDisplay`, `NowPlayingBanner`, `MovieImage`, `GenreTag`, `StarRating`)
- Data flows correctly from parent to child through props
- The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original
