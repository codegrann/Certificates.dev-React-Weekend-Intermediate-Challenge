# Bootstrap a React App

## Challenge Description

In this coding challenge, you will create a new React application using Vite.

## Requirements

- Create a new React application with `npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react`
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install dependencies
- Start up the dev server
- Take note of the project structure that Vite creates for you
- Observe the fast startup time compared to other build tools
- Pay attention to Fast Refresh - a feature that lets you edit React components without losing their state, providing instant feedback during development

## Other Considerations

- You can call the project whatever you want, but make sure to use the React template

> 💡 INFO: Most lessons include some starter boilerplate code to download. This challenge is the exception. Complete it on your local machine.
